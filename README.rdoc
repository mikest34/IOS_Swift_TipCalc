= Swift tutorial

I built a tip calculator application from the tutorial available at the below URL. Working on learning IOS development and this was interesting. A few additions I made:

- Added decimal formatting. Key reference: https://devforums.apple.com/message/973494
- Changed the text of the output a bit from what was referenced.
- worked on getting the bill cost text input to clear when tapped (not completed)
